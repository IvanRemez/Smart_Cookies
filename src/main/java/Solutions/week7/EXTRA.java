/*
Problem:

Write a function that takes an integer array, counts each number and prints a sentence to say how many
times a number is repeated. Number order is not important.

Example:

input Â© array ={1,2,3,4,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2, 2}
output :

1 is two times

3 is three times

4 is two times

2 is more than ten times
