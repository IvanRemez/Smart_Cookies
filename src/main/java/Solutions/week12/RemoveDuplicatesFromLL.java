Question-2 Remove Duplicates From Linked List

You're given the head of a Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order with respect to their values.
Write a function that returns a modified version of the Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values.
The Linked List should be modified in place (i.e., you shouldn't create a brand-new list), and the modified Linked List
should still have its nodes sorted with respect to their values. Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a
next node pointing to the next node in the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3] Output: [1,2,3]
Example:
Input: [1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6] // the head node with value 1 Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6] // the head node with value 1

Constraints:
• The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
• -100 <= Node.val <= 100
• The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
