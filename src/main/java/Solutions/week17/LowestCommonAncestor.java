Question-1 Find the Lowest Common Ancestor
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two
given nodes in the BST. According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest
common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has
both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

(CHECK PDF FOR TREE EXAMPLES)

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105]. -109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.
