Given an unsorted integer array, return all greater elements than all elements present to their right using Stack.
Example:
Input: [10, 4, 6, 3, 5]
Output: [10, 6, 5]
The elements that are greater than all elements to their right are 10, 6, and 5. 10>4 & 10>6 & 10>3 & 10>5

class Main{
// Function to print all elements which are greater than all
// elements present to their right
public List<Integer> find(int[] arr){
    }
}
Please, try to test your solution via JUnit.
