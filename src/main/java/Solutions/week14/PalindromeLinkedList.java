Question-2 Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1, 2, 2, 1] Output: true
Example 2:
Input: head = [1, 2] Output: false

Constraints:
• The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10^5].
• 0 <= Node.val <= 9
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
